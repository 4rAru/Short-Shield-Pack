# Short Shield Pack

I don't know when it became impossible to make shields transparent, but when playing minecraft, shields occupy my field of view and get in the way, so I made this.
This texture pack is available for ver 1.9 or later.

Just in case someone is playing minecraft on 1.9, I apologize.
Sorry.
