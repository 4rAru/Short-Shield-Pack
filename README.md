short shield pack

●Overview.
I don't know when it became impossible to make shields transparent, but when playing minecraft, shields occupy my field of view and get in the way, so I made this.
This texture pack is available for ver 1.9 or later.

●Confirmed version
1.12.2 and 1.16.5 or later

●Attention
It's possible it won't work with ver 1.9, but who would mikra with 1.9, indeed!
Just in case someone is playing minecraft on 1.9, I apologize.
Sorry.
